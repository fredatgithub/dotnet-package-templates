## About

### What's this?

A bunch of `dotnet new` templates to quickly get you started building high-quality libraries including everything you need to publish it on NuGet or make it available as open-source.

It includes:
* Multi-targeting to cover as many .NET frameworks as possible
* Code coverage using [Coverlet](https://github.com/coverlet-coverage/coverlet) and [Coveralls.io](https://coveralls.io/)
* Static code analysis using Roslyn analyzers [StyleCopAnalyzers](https://github.com/DotNetAnalyzers/StyleCopAnalyzers), [Roslynator](https://github.com/dotnet/roslynator), [CSharpGuidelinesAnalyzer](https://github.com/bkoelman/CSharpGuidelinesAnalyzer) and [Meziantou](https://github.com/meziantou/Meziantou.Framework).
* Auto-formatting using `.editorconfig` and settings honored by [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) and [ReSharper](https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/)
* A [Nuke](https://nuke.build/) C# build script that you can run locally as well as in your CI/CD pipeline
* A GitHub Actions workflow that builds, tests, packages and publishes your library
* An extensive read-me
* Automatic versioning using [GitVersion](https://gitversion.net/) and tagging
* Contribution guidelines
* Bug report templates
* Customized release notes templates for GitHub connected to pull requests labels.
* Support for content-only NuGet packages
* A test project using [xUnit](https://xunit.net/) and [Fluent Assertions 7](https://fluentassertions.com/)
* Validation of the public API of the library against snapshots using [Verify](https://github.com/VerifyTests/Verify)

### What's so special about that?

I like to build my software systems in a nicely broken down set of libraries that are easy to maintain, test and deploy based on the [Principles Of Successful Package Management](https://www.dennisdoomen.com/2016/10/principles-for-successful-package.html). But every time I or the teams I work with need to start a new library or reusable component, we have to scramble so much from other projects, I felt this good fill the gap.

This is the result of years of experience in building in-house and open-source libraries that are used by thousands of developers around the world. I hope it's a great starting point for building your own libraries.

**Tip** You can use this as a starting point for a [GitHub Template Repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-template-repository), fork the repository for your own company, or use it as an organization template in Azure DevOps.

### Who created this?
My name is Dennis Doomen and I'm a Microsoft MVP and Principal Consultant at [Aviva Solutions](https://avivasolutions.nl/) with 28 years of experience under my belt. As a software architect and/or lead developer, I specialize in designing full-stack enterprise solutions based on .NET as well as providing coaching on all aspects of designing, building, deploying and maintaining software systems. I'm the author of several open-source projects such as [Fluent Assertions](https://www.fluentassertions.com), [Reflectify](https://github.com/dennisdoomen/reflectify), [Liquid Projections](https://www.liquidprojections.net), and I've been maintaining [coding guidelines for C#](https://www.csharpcodingguidelines.com) since 2001.

## Download

This library is available as [a NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/dotet) on https://nuget.org. To install it, use the following command-line:

`dotnet new install DotNetLibraryPackageTemplates`

## How do I use it?

1. Create a new directory for your library initialized with Git
2. Run `dotnet new class-library-package-solution -name MyAwesomeLibrary`
3. Make the necessary changes to the generated code
4. Commit the changes to your repository into a new commit
5. Run `build.ps1` to build the code, run the tests, and package the library into a NuGet package in the `Artifacts` directory.

## Building

To build this repository locally, you need the following:
* The [.NET SDKs](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/visual-studio-sdks) for .NET 4.7, 6.0 and 8.0.
* Visual Studio, JetBrains Rider or Visual Studio Code with the C# DevKit

You can also build, run the unit tests and package the code using the following command-line:

`build.ps1`

Or, if you have, the [Nuke tool installed](https://nuke.build/docs/getting-started/installation/):

`nuke`

Also try using `--help` to see all the available options or `--plan` to see what the scripts does.
